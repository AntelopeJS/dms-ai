/**
 * A UTF-8 path for preserving raw path compatibility at the app-server API
 * boundary while Codex migrates to [`PathUri`].
 *
 * Supports storing arbitrary strings read from the API and converting to and
 * from [`PathUri`] using an explicitly selected native path convention.
 *
 * When converting from [`PathUri`], "native" refers to the supplied
 * [`PathConvention`], which may be foreign to the operating system running
 * this process. The inner string is private so path-producing code must use a
 * path conversion method instead of bypassing the intended conversion
 * boundary. Non-UTF-8 paths are converted to UTF-8 lossily because this API
 * value is serialized as a JSON string.
 *
 * Deserialization and [`Self::from_string`] accept any UTF-8 string without
 * interpreting or validating it. Use [`Self::from_string`] when a caller
 * already owns legacy app-server path text and needs to preserve its wire
 * spelling; use [`Self::from_path`], [`Self::from_abs_path`], or
 * [`Self::from_path_uri`] when converting an actual path value. Relative
 * path text remains valid until an operation such as [`Self::to_path_uri`]
 * requires an absolute path.
